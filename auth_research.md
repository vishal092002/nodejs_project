# Authentication Options Research

## Option 1: Basic Authentication

### Overview
Basic Authentication is one of the most simple methods of HTTP authentication. When a client sends a request to a server, the server can respond with a `401 Unauthorized` status code, prompting the client to authenticate. To authenticate, the client sends another HTTP request with an `Authorization` header, which contains the word 'Basic' followed by a space and a base64-encoded `username:password` string.

### How It Works
1. Client sends a request to the server.
2. Server responds with `401 Unauthorized` and a `WWW-Authenticate: Basic` header if authentication is required.
3. Client sends another request with an `Authorization` header containing base64-encoded credentials.
4. Server decodes the credentials, verifies them against its data store, and either grants or denies access.

### Pros
- **Simplicity**: There's minimal setup and coding required.
- **Ubiquity**: It's universally supported by web browsers and HTTP clients.

### Cons
- **Security**: Transmitted credentials can be intercepted if not sent over HTTPS. Base64 is easily decoded, exposing the raw credentials.
- **Overhead**: Credentials must be sent with every HTTP request, increasing bandwidth usage.
- **Limited Features**: No built-in support for tokens, expirations, or multi-factor authentication.

## Option 2: OAuth 2.0

### Overview
OAuth 2.0 is a framework, not a protocol, and serves as the successor to OAuth 1.0. It provides specific authorization flows for web applications, desktop applications, mobile phones, and smart devices. Instead of sharing credentials, apps request access tokens from an authorization server and use these tokens to access resources.

### How It Works
1. **Authorization Request**: The client redirects the user to the authorization server to authenticate and grant permission.
2. **Authorization Grant**: After successful authentication, the server sends an authorization code to the client (usually through a redirect).
3. **Access Token Request**: The client requests an access token from the authorization server by presenting its own credentials and the authorization code.
4. **Access Token Response**: The server responds with an access token and an optional refresh token.
5. **Resource Access**: The client accesses the desired resource with the access token.

### Pros
- **Delegated Access**: Third-party apps can access user data without exposing user credentials.
- **Tokens Over Passwords**: Instead of sharing and storing passwords, applications use short-lived tokens, which can be scoped to specific actions.
- **Multiple Flows**: OAuth 2.0 provides different flows suitable for various types of clients, including web apps, mobile apps, and even browser-less devices.
- **Revocable**: Users can revoke access to an application at any time.

### Cons
- **Complexity**: Compared to Basic Authentication, OAuth 2.0 is more complex and requires a deeper understanding for proper implementation.
- **Potential for Misuse**: Incorrect implementation can introduce vulnerabilities. The framework's flexibility, which is a strength, can also be a weakness if not utilized properly.
- **Token Storage**: Secure storage and management of tokens is necessary to prevent misuse.

## Conclusion

**Basic Authentication** is suitable for simple applications with a smaller user base and where security concerns are minimal. However, for any substantial application, especially those exposed to the wider internet or third-party integrations, it's typically not recommended due to its inherent security limitations.

**OAuth 2.0** is the de-facto standard for modern web authentication and authorization, especially for API access. It's best suited for scenarios where security is a priority, and there's a need for flexible, scoped, and delegated access to resources. Its complexity can be mitigated by using well-maintained libraries and following best practices.
